              StarCraft is a military science fiction media franchise created by
              Chris Metzen and James Phinney and owned by Blizzard
              Entertainment. The series, set in the beginning of the 26th
              century, centers on a galactic struggle for dominance among three
              species

              The story focuses on the activities of three species in a part of
              the Milky Way known as the Koprulu Sector. Millennia before any of
              the events of the games, a species known as the Xel'Naga
              genetically engineer the Protoss and later the Zerg in attempts to
              create pure beings. These experiments backfire and the Xel'Naga
              are largely destroyed by the Zerg. Centuries before the beginning
              of StarCraft in 2499, the hardline international government of
              Earth, the United Earth Directorate (UED), commissions a
              colonization program as part of a solution to overpopulation,
              however the computers automating the colony ships malfunction,
              propelling the Terran colonists far off course to the edge of
              Protoss space. Out of contact with Earth, they form various
              factions to maintain their interests. Intrigued by the behavior
              and mentality of the Terrans, the Protoss remain hidden to examine
              the humans, while protecting them from other threats without their
              knowledge. The Zerg, however, target the Terrans for assimilation
              to harness their psionic potential, forcing the Protoss to destroy
              tainted Terran colonies to contain the Zerg infestation.

              The zerg are a biologically-engineered species and the second
              (after the protoss) to be engineered by the xel'naga. Possessing a
              purity of essence, the zerg were originally a race of worm-like
              parasites which over time could "absorb" the genetics of their
              victims. They were controlled by the xel'naga-crafted Overmind,
              which broke contact with the xel'naga and eventually spurred the
              Zerg Swarm into destroying its masters, stealing their knowledge.
              The Zerg Swarm formed into a hierarchy, led by the immortal
              Overmind, the immortal cerebrates underneath it, and the
              overlords. The modern Zerg Swarm emerged as a collection of
              breeds, capable of living in harsh conditions – most were adapted
              for combat. The Overmind became aware of the protoss and was
              determined to assimilate them into its own species. Upon
              discovering the terrans, it intended to assimilate their psionic
              potential to help it in its conquest of the protoss. When the zerg
              overwhelmed Chau Sara, the protoss responded by destroying all
              life on the planet's surface. By then, the zerg had already
              infested numerous other terran worlds. The zerg prepared to fight
              a war with the protoss, leaving the terrans trapped between them.

                The protoss, bereft of their gods (as they viewed the xel'naga),
                fell into the Aeon of Strife, a massive generations-long civil
                war. The mystic Khas, using the power of xel'naga artifacts
                called khaydarin crystals, reforged the protoss psionic link,
                which he called the Khala, and helped heal their racial wound.
                The sanity of the protoss was restored. The new protoss society
                divided itself into three castes – the Judicator Caste which
                consisted of religious leaders, controlled by the Conclave; the
                Templar Caste, the warriors who protected the people; and the
                Khalai Caste, which provided laborers and artisans. The protoss
                used much xel'naga technology. The protoss expanded their
                influence over many worlds formerly controlled by the xel'naga,
                and both protected and manipulated lesser races according to
                their philosophy of Dae'uhl. When the terrans arrived in the
                Koprulu sector, in the shadow of protoss space, the protoss
                secretly protected them too. Shortly before the Great War, the
                protoss became aware of the zerg, another race modified by the
                xel'naga. The zerg had secretly begun infesting a number of
                terran worlds. Executor Tassadar of the Templar Caste was
                ordered to take his fleet and purify the most heavily-infested
                world, Chau Sara. Tassadar followed his orders – sparking panic
                in the Terran Confederacy – but when ordered to purify the next
                world, Mar Sara, he refused, as he believed the terrans there
                still stood a chance against the zerg.

               The humans of Earth fell under the control of the United Powers League in 2229. The new government believed in the "divinity of mankind" and worked to eliminate anyone who had undergone genetic engineering or used non-essential cybernetic equipment. Government forces also cracked down on criminals, religious people, political activists and other "dissidents".

               About forty years later, scientist Doran Routhe collected thousands of such prisoners onto four supercarriers as part of a colonization project. The prisoners were cryogenically frozen and supplied with materials needed to found colonies, including ATLAS, a revolutionary new AI. However, the ships sped right past their target planet.
            
               During the journey, ATLAS detected a relatively high rate of mutations leading to psionic powers in the prisoners, sending the information back to Routhe.
            
               The lost ships ended up in the Koprulu sector after three decades of travel, approximately two hundred years ago. The new terran colonists settled the worlds of Tarsonis, Moria and Umoja. The colonists of Tarsonis had access to ATLAS and would form the most powerful of the three civilizations – the Terran Confederacy.
            
               The Confederacy engaged in economic warfare with the military of the Morian colony, the Kel-Morian Combine, continually stealing their mining claims. Ten years before the Great War, this eventually broke out into the Guild Wars in 2485. The two sides fought for almost four years before the Confederacy claimed victory.
        
               The Confederacy mistreated its colonies, and eventually its most prosperous one, Korhal IV, rebelled against it. The Confederacy killed the rebel leader, Angus Mengsk. However, this action was a mistake, since it put his genius son, Arcturus, in charge. The younger Mengsk immediately began a series of bombings and assassinations. When Mengsk was visiting the allied Umojan Protectorate, the Confederacy struck Korhal IV with a massive nuclear blast, destroying all life on its surface. Mengsk, now calling his rebel movement the Sons of Korhal, continued a guerrilla-style struggle with what few forces remained under his command.

               In his first mission against the Confederacy, he raided a secret installation, rescuing a ghost, Sarah Kerrigan, and becoming aware of secret experiments with newly discovered xenomorphs.
